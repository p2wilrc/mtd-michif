# Turtle Mountain Michif Dictionary Web UI

MTD is the second of two open-source tools that allow language communities and
developers to quickly and inexpensively make their dictionary data digitally
accessible. MTD-UI is a tool that visualizes dictionary data that is prepared
with [MTD](https://github.com/roedoejet/mothertongues). This is a web version
constructed for the Michif language.

for more information.
